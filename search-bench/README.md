# Datalevin Search Benchmark

To measure the performance of Datalevin search engine, we stacked it up against
the most prominent full-text search library in the Java world, the venerable
Apache Lucene.

## Test Data

The data source is [Wikipedia database backup dump](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/enwiki-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2), over 18GB XML compressed.

For our purpose, we use
[WikiExtractor](https://github.com/attardi/wikiextractor), a python script, to
extract all articles into a JSON file. Furthermore, we use
[jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) to remove articles containing less than 500
characters (e.g. those only refer to other articles) and strip away unneeded
meta data, just leaving article content as the text and url as the identifier.

```console
wget https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/enwiki-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2

wikiextractor -o - --json --no-templates enwiki-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2 |
jq -s '.[] | select((.text | length) > 500) | {url, text}' > wiki.json

```
This may take a few of hours to run, depending on your hardware. It produces a JSON
file containing over 6.3 million articles, totaling 15GB of text.

## Test Queries

The test queries are downloaded from [TREC 2009 Million Query
Track](https://trec.nist.gov/data/million.query09.html). These are queries
typed by real users on the Web. We remove unnecessary meta content and leaves
query text only:

```console
wget https://trec.nist.gov/data/million.query/09/09.mq.topics.20001-60000.gz
gzip -d 09.mq.topics.20001-60000.gz
mv 09.mq.topics.20001-60000 queries40k.txt
sed -i -e 's/\([0-9]\+\)\:[0-9]\://g' queries40k.txt
```
This produces a text file containing 40000 queries, totaling 685KB.

## Test Conditions

The same conditions were applied to both Datalevin and Lucene:

* A single thread was used to add all documents during indexing.

* Indices were stored on the same disk as input data.

* Punctuation and stop words were removed; the same stop words list was used in
  both Datalevin and Lucene; stemming was not performed, as per the
  default settings of Lucene `ClassicAnalyzer`.

* Query terms were `OR`ed together, per Lucene default. That is, documents matching
  any of the query terms are potential results.

* Top 10 results were returned for each query, only URLs of the articles were returned.

* Concurrent searches were performed by submitting each search query to a thread pool.

* Tests were conducted on an Intel Core i7-6850K CPU @ 3.60GHz with 6 cores (12
  virtual cores), 64GB RAM, 1TB SSD, running Ubuntu 20.04 and OpenJDK 17
  (2021-09-14), with Clojure 1.10.3.

Run benchmarks:

```
clj -X:datalevin
clj -X:lucene
```

The benchmarks took a couple of hours to run, mainly spending time indexing.

## Result

### Indexing

Indexing performance is in the following table.

|Measure   | Datalevin | Lucene |
|----|--------|--------|
| Index time (Hours)  | 1.6  | 0.3  |
| Index size (GB)  | 79  |  13      |
| Index Speed (GB/Hour)  | 9.4  |  40.6      |

Lucene is more than 5 times faster than Datalevin at bulk indexing, and the resulting
index size is also similarly smaller.

This is expected, as Datalevin transact the indices to the database,
with all its integrity checks and so on. Datalevin data is also not presently
compressed (this is on the roadmap), so the data size is larger.

One benefit of storing search index in a transactional database, is that the
documents become immediately searchable, while Lucene commits documents in very
large batches, so they are not immediately searchable.

### Searching

We varied the number of threads used for performing concurrent search. The
results are the following:

#### Search Latency (ms)

Here's the average and percentile break-down of search latency (ms) for one
search thread:

|Percentile | Datalevin | Lucene |
|----|--------|--------|
|median | 1 | 3 |
|75 |3 |    4           |
|90 |6 |  6            |
|95 |11 |  11      |
|99 |37 |   16           |
|99.9 |170 |  31            |
|max |659 | 138 |
|mean | 3 |    4  |

Search latency are similar across the number of threads, with slightly longer
time when more threads are used (with about 1 ms mean difference between 1 and
12 threads).

Datalevin is 75% faster on average, while 3 times faster at median. Datalevin
has much longer query time for outliers than Lucene, bringing down the mean
considerably.

This should be attributed to the fact that we use idiomatic Clojure for the most
part of the code at the moment. It is known that idiomatic Clojure are slower
than Java due to pervasive use of immutable data structures.

For queries with huge candidate set, the fixed cost of slower code adds up to
overcome the superiority in algorithm. For example, the slowest query is
"s", there's not much room for algorithmic cleverness here, the only
solution is brutal-force iterating the whole 3 million matching documents. So
basically, the contest here is raw iteration speed, it should not be a surprise
that idiomatic Clojure loses to optimized Java code here.

#### Search Throughput (Query per Second)

|Number of threads | Datalevin | Lucene |
|----|--------|--------|
|1 |310 | 206 |
|2 |597 |    404           |
|3 |870 |  588            |
|4 |1143 |  784      |
|5 |1379 |   975           |
|6 |1600 |  1143            |
|7 |1667 | 1176 |
|8 |1739 |    1212           |
|9 |1818 |  1250            |
|10 |1818 |  1290      |
|11 |1904 |   1333           |
|12 |1904 | 1333       |
|forkjoin |2000 | 1379       |

Datalevin has about 75% higher search throughput, as expected from the means.

For both search engines, search throughput grows linearly with the
number of real CPU cores, so search is a CPU bound task. Past the number of real
cores, adding more threads improves search throughput very little. Using a work
stealing thread pool does improve the throughput a bit than the maximum number of
fixed thread pool.

## Remarks

Lucene query parser seems to be rather picky. We had to manually fix some
queries for the test to run. E.g. Lucene crashed with the query "\"ground beef
recipes\'" for the mismatched quotes. The parser did not support concurrent
query. A new parser has to be created for each query, otherwise the program
would crash if there were more than one thread searching. Basically, some engineering
effort is required for it to be suitable for end user facing applications.

The design of Lucene and Datalevin search engine differs significantly, lending
to different use cases.

Datalevin is designed as an operational database. Datalevin search engine stores
search indices by transacting them into a LMDB database, and the documents are
immediately searchable. Since LMDB has a single writer, having
multiple indexing threads does little to improve the data ingestion speed. On
the other hand, Lucene writes to multiple independent index segments and support great
concurrency while indexing. Therefore, some use cases that Lucene family of
search engines excel in, such as log ingestion, are not suitable for Datalevin.

Lucene has perhaps hundreds of man-years behind its development and is extremely
configurable, while Datalevin search engine is embedded in a newly developed
database with *simplicity* as its motto, so it does not offer any bells and
whistles other than the core search features.

On the other hand, Datalevin search engine already performs very well, and still
has some low-hanging fruits for performance improvement. It will be nicely
integrated with other Datalevin database features to supports our goal of
simplifying data access.
